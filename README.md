# Getting Started

This project provides a web album system that allows users to easily manage their yearly photos automatically, without any coding, using free GitHub resources. Users only need to submit a Pull Request (PR) uploading their photos in *.jpg format to year-specific folders. Once the PR is merged, all the necessary work for displaying the photos on the website is performed automatically.

Here's the simple procedure for users:

1. Let's assume you have a photo taken with your camera, named 20240918-140030.jpg.
2. Upload this *.jpg format file to the ./2024/ folder.
3. Click the "Create a Pull Request" button.
4. After review, click the "Merge a Pull Request" button to merge the uploaded PR.
5. That's it! In about 3 minutes, when you access the website, you'll see your uploaded photo displayed in your web album.

This easy process allows you to maintain and showcase your yearly photo collections effortlessly through a simple GitHub workflow.
